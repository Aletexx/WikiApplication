# WikiApplication
Made by: Alessandro Bastos
The essence of this project was to develop a replica of wiki application, fully functional wiki system from scratch using Java modules (J2EE, JSTL Tags, Java Bean, and Servlets) with MVC framework concept and MySQL database.
Wiki Portal: The wiki portal holds all articles (visible for all visitors) and any visitor can view all the visible articles.
Admin console: It holds all the functionality of wiki management. A registered user/admin (after login) can perform CRUD operations (create/edit/delete articles).
Therefore, Wiki application consists of three modules of the web-based system:
1. Login Authentication for Security
2. Wiki portal for User for Front-end User Interface
3. Admin Console for Back-end Administration Interface
Skills: Java · Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) · MySQL · Model-View-Controller (MVC) · HTML · CSS
